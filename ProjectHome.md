Share-a-Bike is an application for the WebOS platform that aids in the location of bike sharing kiosks.

Currently, only BCycle kiosks are supported.

Please visit the BCycle website at http://bcycle.com/ to see the communities where BCycle is.

Share-a-bike is no longer developed or maintained since WebOS is essentially a dead platform.

Share-a-bike is a [ShoupTech](http://www.shouptech.com/code/) project.
